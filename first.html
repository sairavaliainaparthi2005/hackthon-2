    <p>DevOps is a modern software development approach combining "Development" and "Operations" to improve collaboration, automation, and continuous delivery throughout the software lifecycle. Key concepts include Collaboration, Automation, Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD), Continuous Monitoring, and Continuous Feedback. The goal is to deliver high-quality software reliably and rapidly by integrating development and operations teams and automating processes like coding, testing, and deployment.  </p>
